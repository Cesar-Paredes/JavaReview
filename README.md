# Password_Generator
Password generator program 

I built this application using Java with OOP.

This program generates 1000 passwords and uses the words that are inside a text. The text is a store "Alice in Wonderland"

Rules for each password:
At least 8 characters
At least 1 special character
At leas 1 upper case
At least 1 lowe case
Can't repeat the same word inside the password

The output:
It takes every word in the text and then starts analyzing them to be able to reach the desire outcome, 
also it will give us the reasons why it didint take the words previous to the choosen password.

Length 1: It means it didn't take 1 previous word because of the lenght
Same word 1: It means it didn't take 1 previous word because the word was repeated inside the potential password.
Single 1: It means it didn't take 1 previous word because the word was just one character
Upper 1: It means it didn't take 1 previous word because the word had no upper case
Lower 1: It means it didn't take 1 previous word because the word had no lower case
New Line 1: It means it didn't take 1 previous word because the word had a new line.
Special Char 1: It means it didn't take 1 previous word because the word had no special characters.
