# Password_Generator
Password generator program 

I built this application using Java with OOP.

This program generates 1000 passwords and uses the words that are inside a text. The text is a store "Alice in Wonderland" <br/>

Rules for each password:<br/>
At least 8 characters<br/>
At least 1 special character<br/>
At leas 1 upper case<br/>
At least 1 lowe case<br/>
Can't repeat the same word inside the password<br/>
<br/>
The output:<br/>
It takes every word in the text and then starts analyzing them to be able to reach the desire outcome, <br/>
also it will give us the reasons why it didint take the words previous to the choosen password.<br/>
<br/>
Length 1: It means it didn't take 1 previous word because of the lenght<br/>
Same word 1: It means it didn't take 1 previous word because the word was repeated inside the potential password.<br/>
Single 1: It means it didn't take 1 previous word because the word was just one character<br/>
Upper 1: It means it didn't take 1 previous word because the word had no upper case<br/>
Lower 1: It means it didn't take 1 previous word because the word had no lower case<br/>
New Line 1: It means it didn't take 1 previous word because the word had a new line.<br/>
Special Char 1: It means it didn't take 1 previous word because the word had no special characters.<br/>
<br/>
